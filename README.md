Purpose:

The project aims to interface with a CubiScan machine, a device used for measuring the dimensions and weight of objects, typically in a warehouse or shipping setting.
Payload Parsing:

The code defines a MeasureScan namedtuple to structure the data retrieved from the CubiScan machine, including length, width, height, weight, dimensional weight, and a factor.
Communication Protocol:

The CS_PREFIX and CS_SUFFIX constants represent the start and end of a payload, creating a simple protocol for parsing incoming data.
Serial Communication:

The CubiScanScanner class initializes a serial connection (self._serial) to the CubiScan machine using the serial library.
Payload Conversion:

The convert function processes the payload received from the CubiScan machine, extracting relevant measurements and converting them into a structured format using the MeasureScan namedtuple.
Error Handling:

The code incorporates error handling, such as raising a RuntimeError if an unrecognized measurement payload is encountered.
Scanning and Measurement:

The read_scans method continuously reads data from the serial connection and parses it into meaningful measurements using the _parse_bytes method.
Initialization:

The __init__ method of the CubiScanScanner class initializes the serial connection based on the provided COM port (comport).
Project Context:

The comments within the code reference the CubiScan 125 documentation, suggesting adherence to the specifications provided by the manufacturer for proper integration.
Legacy System Integration:

Given the mention of a legacy system, this code likely forms part of a larger software infrastructure used by your company for managing inventory, shipments, or related operations.
Maintenance Considerations:

As this is part of an older system, maintenance considerations might involve assessing compatibility with modern systems, potential updates to libraries, or future integration with newer technologies.
